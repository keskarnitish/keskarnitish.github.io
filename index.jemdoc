I'm a researcher at [http://www.openai.com OpenAI] where I work on large language models. Previously, I was a Principal Research Scientist at [https://einstein.ai/ Salesforce Research] in Palo Alto where I worked on both research and applications of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques.

I received my PhD from [http://www.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern University] in 2017 under the supervision of [http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/ Prof. Jorge Nocedal] and [http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~andreasw/ Prof. Andreas Waechter]. For my PhD, I focused on efficiently finding solutions to Mathematical Optimization problems which are nonsmooth or stochastic. This includes several problems in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Over the years, I have been fortunate to be able to work on a broad set of topics such as:

- Language Modeling ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182 AWD-LSTM], [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858 CTRL], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06367 GeDi])
- Multitask Learning ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08730 decaNLP])
- Machine Translation ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02132 Weighted Transformer])
- Paraphrasing ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12885 Unsupervised Paraphrasing])
- Subword Tokenization ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12730 Char2Subword])
- Model Security ([https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.501/ Multilingual Stealing])
- Extending Transformer Language Models to Protein Generation ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03497 ProGen])
- Generalization and Deep Learning ([https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1oyRlYgg Large Batch Training and Sharp Minima], [http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/wang20f.html PAC-Bayes Approach], [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10245 Path Sampling])
- Mathematical Optimization ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07628 Hybrid SGD-Adam Optimizer], [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10556788.2016.1138222 L1-norm Minimization], [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10556788.2017.1378652?journalCode=goms20 Nonsmooth L-BFGS], [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7178917 Nonmonotone SGD], [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46128-1_1 adaQN])
- Medical AI ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19334-3 Breast Cancer Detection])

My [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CJ-_cEEAAAAJ&hl=en Google Scholar] contains a list of all my publications. 


I am also interested in machine learning systems and tooling. I have also authored an engineering blog on [https://blog.einstein.ai/benchmarking-tensorrt-inference-server/ efficient serving of BERT-like models].
