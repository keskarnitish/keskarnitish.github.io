I'm a Principal Research Scientist at Salesforce Research in Palo Alto where I work on Deep Learning and its applications to Natural Language Processing. I am particularly interested in large language models (LLMs), efficient training methods, and issues pertaining to generalization and scalability. I am also interested in Deep Learning systems and tooling. 

I received my PhD from [http://www.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern University] in 2017 under the supervision of [http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/ Prof. Jorge Nocedal] and [http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~andreasw/ Prof. Andreas Waechter]. For my PhD, I focused on efficiently finding solutions to Mathematical Optimization problems which are nonsmooth or stochastic. This includes several problems in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
